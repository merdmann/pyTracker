# pyTracker
Test Environment Demo


# Project structure

The project structure  is following the basic concepts described here: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/.

* ./core modules contains the main logic
* ./helper module contains a set of general helper functions


# Sprint objectives

* Sprint_1 The objective of Sprint_1 is to provide the project foundation which it to be used in the 
  following sprints by adding further modules.

* Sprint 2a  Actually the requirements for Sprint_1 have not been totally described a  few small
  this need to be added. So i am getting an unplanned sprint because of my execution environment.
  * It shall be possible to start pytracker from any place with a valid path.
  * The parallel support of windows and cygwin with respect to deployment and application
    started will be skiped for a good extend  because the shell in cygwin does not work well. Consequently
    rand 2a will be deleted.
